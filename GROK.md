As a Project Manager tasked with overseeing the development of a Customer Service Chat Module, your goal is to communicate the requirements to the developers in a clear, concise, and comprehensive manner. Below, I’ll outline the system details—technology stack, requirements, database architecture, APIs, frontend pages, roles, and development steps—followed by specific strategies to ensure the developers understand everything easily.

---

### System Overview
The Customer Service Chat Module facilitates communication between **end users** (customers) and **merchants** (businesses). It’s a real-time chat system with specific rules: only end users can initiate conversations, and when merchants reply, the current staff member’s name must be displayed in the conversation. The system leverages a modern tech stack for scalability and efficiency.

#### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: NextJS, Typescript, SocketIO (for real-time messaging)
- **Backend**: Typescript, Prisma (ORM for database interactions)
- **Database**: Postgres, containerized with Docker

---

### Requirements Breakdown
1. **Roles**:
   - **End User**: Customers who start conversations with merchants.
   - **Merchant**: Businesses with staff who respond to end users. Merchant staff roles include:
     - **Company Admin**: Full control, manages staff and conversations.
     - **Manager**: Assigns conversations to staff, monitors activity.
     - **Staff**: Responds to end users in chats.

2. **Conversation Rules**:
   - Only end users can start conversations; merchants cannot initiate.
   - When a merchant staff member replies, their name must appear in the conversation thread alongside their message.

3. **Real-Time Functionality**: Messages should update instantly for all participants using SocketIO.

### Database Architecture
To support the requirements, the database needs tables to manage users, merchants, conversations, and messages. Here’s the schema:

#### Tables and Relationships
- **Merchants**:
  - `id` (primary key)
  - `name` (string, e.g., "MerchantX")
  - Purpose: Stores merchant company information.

- **Users**:
  - `id` (primary key)
  - `name` (string, e.g., "John Doe")
  - `email` (string, unique)
  - `type` (enum: 'end_user' or 'merchant_staff')
  - `merchant_id` (foreign key to Merchants, nullable for end users)
  - `role` (enum: 'admin', 'manager', 'staff', nullable for end users)
  - Purpose: Stores all individuals. For merchant staff, `merchant_id` links to their employer, and `role` defines their position.

- **Conversations**:
  - `id` (primary key)
  - `end_user_id` (foreign key to Users, the conversation starter)
  - `merchant_id` (foreign key to Merchants, the recipient business)
  - `assigned_to` (foreign key to Users, nullable, the staff member handling it)
  - `started_at` (timestamp)
  - Purpose: Tracks each conversation, linking an end user to a merchant, with an optional staff assignment.

- **Messages**:
  - `id` (primary key)
  - `conversation_id` (foreign key to Conversations)
  - `sender_id` (foreign key to Users, either end user or staff)
  - `message_text` (string)
  - `sent_at` (timestamp)
  - Purpose: Stores individual messages, identifying the sender.

#### Key Relationships
- A **User** with `type='merchant_staff'` is linked to a **Merchant** via `merchant_id`.
- A **Conversation** connects one **User** (end user) to one **Merchant**, with an optional `assigned_to` staff member (also a User).
- **Messages** are tied to a **Conversation** and a **User** (sender).

#### Notes
- When a staff member replies, `sender_id` in **Messages** identifies them, and their name (from **Users**) is displayed.
- `assigned_to` in **Conversations** tracks the current staff member, updated when a manager assigns or a staff member first replies.

### API Listing and Functionalities
The backend requires REST APIs for core actions and SocketIO for real-time messaging. All APIs assume JWT-based authentication, with permissions based on user type and role.

#### REST APIs
1. **Start Conversation**:
   - Endpoint: `POST /api/conversations`
   - Body: `{ merchantId: number }`
   - Returns: `{ conversationId: number }`
   - Permission: End users only
   - Function: Creates a new conversation between the authenticated end user and the specified merchant.

2. **Get My Conversations**:
   - Endpoint: `GET /api/conversations`
   - Returns: Array of conversations `{ id, merchantName, lastMessage, assignedToName, startedAt }`
   - Permission: End users see their conversations; merchant staff see all conversations for their merchant.
   - Function: Lists conversations relevant to the authenticated user.

3. **Get Conversation Details**:
   - Endpoint: `GET /api/conversations/:id`
   - Returns: `{ id, endUserName, merchantName, assignedToName, messages: [{ id, senderName, text, sentAt }] }`
   - Permission: End user of the conversation or staff of the merchant
   - Function: Fetches a conversation’s details and message history.

4. **Send Message**:
   - Endpoint: `POST /api/conversations/:id/messages`
   - Body: `{ text: string }`
   - Returns: `{ messageId: number }`
   - Permission: End user of the conversation or staff of its merchant
   - Function: Adds a message to the conversation, triggers real-time update.

5. **Assign Conversation**:
   - Endpoint: `PUT /api/conversations/:id/assign`
   - Body: `{ staffId: number }`
   - Returns: Success confirmation
   - Permission: Merchant managers and admins only
   - Function: Assigns a staff member to the conversation.

#### SocketIO Events
- **Join Conversation**: Users join a room (e.g., `conversation_<id>`) when viewing a chat.
- **New Message**: 
  - Event: `message`
  - Payload: `{ conversationId, senderName, text, sentAt }`
  - Function: Broadcasts new messages to room participants in real-time.

#### Authorization Rules
- **Send Message**: If sender is staff, `merchant_id` must match the conversation’s `merchant_id`.
- **Assign Conversation**: `staffId` must be a staff member of the conversation’s merchant.

### Frontend Page Listing and Main Components
Using NextJS, the frontend includes pages and reusable components tailored to user roles.

#### Pages
1. **Login**:
   - Purpose: Authenticates users (end users and staff).
2. **Register**:
   - Purpose: Allows end users to sign up (staff added by admins).
3. **End User Home**:
   - Purpose: Lists merchants or provides a way to select one to chat with.
4. **Conversation List**:
   - Purpose: Displays user’s conversations (end users see theirs; staff see merchant’s).
5. **Chat Page**:
   - Purpose: Shows message history and input for a conversation (used by both end users and staff).
6. **Merchant Dashboard**:
   - Purpose: Lists merchant conversations, with assignment options for managers/admins.
7. **Staff Management**:
   - Purpose: Admins add/remove staff and set roles.

#### Main Components
- **Message**:
  - Props: `{ senderName, text, sentAt }`
  - Displays a single message with the sender’s name (e.g., "John: Hello").
- **Message Input**:
  - Handles sending messages via API and SocketIO.
- **Conversation List Item**:
  - Props: `{ id, merchantName/endUserName, lastMessage, unreadCount }`
  - Shows conversation preview.
- **Merchant Selector**:
  - Used in End User Home to pick a merchant.

#### Chat Page Details
- Displays messages with sender names.
- For merchant replies, shows staff name (e.g., "John from MerchantX").
- Header shows assignment (e.g., "Chatting with John" or "MerchantX Support" if unassigned).
- Real-time updates via SocketIO.

### Making Requirements Clear for Developers
As a Project Manager, clarity is critical. Here’s how to ensure developers understand the requirements:

1. **Provide a Detailed Specification Document**:
   - **Overview**: Summarize the system’s purpose and tech stack.
   - **Roles and Permissions**: List end user and merchant staff capabilities.
   - **Database Schema**: Include table definitions and relationships (e.g., an ERD diagram).
   - **APIs**: Detail endpoints, inputs, outputs, and permissions.
   - **Frontend**: Describe pages, components, and real-time features.
   - **Assumptions**: Note decisions like “staff can reply to any merchant conversation unless assigned.”

2. **Use Visual Aids**:
   - **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)**: Show tables and links (e.g., Users to Conversations).
   - **Flowchart**: Illustrate conversation flow (end user starts → staff replies → name shown).

3. **Define User Stories**:
   - “As an end user, I want to start a chat with a merchant so I can ask questions.”
   - “As a staff member, I want to reply to customers and have my name shown.”
   - “As a manager, I want to assign chats to staff for efficient handling.”

4. **Set Up Communication Channels**:
   - Schedule a kickoff meeting to walk through the spec.
   - Use a tool like Slack or Jira for ongoing questions.
   - Hold regular check-ins to clarify doubts.

5. **Clarify Ambiguities**:
   - Explain “current staff’s name” as “the sender’s name on each merchant message, with optional assignment tracking.”
   - Confirm staff can reply to any merchant conversation unless restricted (not specified).

By delivering a structured spec, visual diagrams, and open communication, you’ll empower developers to build the chat module efficiently and accurately.
